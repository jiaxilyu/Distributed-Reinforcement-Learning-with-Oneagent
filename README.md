# Distributed-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Oneagent
## overview
This repository provides code example for few popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented by distributed reinforcement learning framework Oneagent. These examples are meant to serve as a tutorial of Oneagent and a learning resources of reinforcement learning.

### List of Implemented Algorithms
+ DQN(Deep Q-Learning)
    + DQN Vanilla
    + Double DQN
    + Dueling DQN

+ PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization)
    + continuous PPO
    + Discrete PPO

+ DDPG(deep deterministic policy gradient)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more implementation of reinforcement learning algorithm.

All code is written in Python 3 and pytorch, uses RL environments from OpenAI Gym.
